\begin{abstract}
E-Infrastructure has, over the years, proven its worth in enabling scientific collaboration, even at regional and global scales. The adoption of common platforms such as HPC, data management, etc has made sharing of scientific data, applications and research outputs more appealing and is accelerating scientific output, especially in regions where these were previously unavailable - particularly Africa, and areas of the Arab-speaking world. The CHAIN-REDS and ei4Africa projects have supported the development of the Africa-Arabia Regional Operations Centre (AAROC). The ROC acts as a coordination point, first for grid infrastructures, but has been expanded to more general collaboration infrastructure services such as science gateways, federated identity providers, document and data repositories, etc. This expansion of service offering to ever-more demanding research communities places unreasonable strain on a fully-distributed model, where every site administrator is expected to understand and operate these new services. This is particularly true in the African and Arabian regions, where knowledge networks are sparse.

This contribution describes a development and deployment philosophy which adopts a "DevOps" paradigm which aims to encode models of services using Ansible, with Github and Slack as collaboration platforms. Site and service configuration has been coded into Ansible playbooks, providing a reproducible model of the service, which can be customised as desired on a per-site basis. Most importantly, this model is executable, meaning that any number of sites and services can be effectively deployed remotely, by a core team. Continuous integration is done at every commit of code, by executing the playbooks on a cloud-based development site, which provides transparency to the remote site administrators.

The adoption of this methodology helps to solve the problems of sustainably maintaining service configuration, improving communication between site operations and service developers, ensuring the proper state of services, and verifying the state of deployment.

Some of the main benefits of this approach are speeding up the deployment of new services, reliably applying updates and recovering from disaster. In this contribution, we show that the "traditional" HPC and grid service deployment can be reproduced and improved, by adopting a more modern operations stack. However, we also highlight how this has helped to deploy advanced services-  federated identity infrastructure, science gateways, application repositories, and Open Access repositories in particular throughout the region in short time, and is now playing a crucial role in the strengthening of technical and scientific collaboration networks in the region.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

% general description of how e-Infrastructure has evolved over the years resulting in the formation of the Africa-Arabia Regional Operations Centre.

Distributed computing infrastrucutres - primarly based on the grid computing paradigm - gained popularity during the 1990's and maturity in the 2000's, as they were developed in order to address the computing requirements of large experiments and scientific collaborations.

\section{Challenges of training, deployment and operations}

% training takes  a lot of time

\subsection{Selecting a Template (Heading 2)}

First, confirm that you have the correct template for your paper size. This template has been tailored for output on the US-letter paper size. Please do not use it for A4 paper since the margin requirements for A4 papers may be different from Letter paper size.

\subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

The template is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin in this template measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. Please do not revise any of the current designations

\section{MATH}

Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a separate text file. Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been formatted and styled. Do not use hard tabs, and limit use of hard returns to only one return at the end of a paragraph. Do not add any kind of pagination anywhere in the paper. Do not number text heads-the template will do that for you.

Finally, complete content and organizational editing before formatting. Please take note of the following items when proofreading spelling and grammar:

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms} Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, sc, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}

\begin{itemize}

\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as 3.5-inch disk drive.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: Wb/m2 or webers per square meter, not webers/m2.  Spell out units when they appear in text: . . . a few henries, not . . . a few H.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: 0.25, not .25. Use cm3, not cc. (bullet list)

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Equations}

The equations are an exception to the prescribed specifications of this template. You will need to determine whether or not your equation should be typed using either the Times New Roman or the Symbol font (please no other font). To create multileveled equations, it may be necessary to treat the equation as a graphic and insert it into the text after your paper is styled. Number equations consecutively. Equation numbers, within parentheses, are to position flush right, as in (1), using a right tab stop. To make your equations more compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function, or appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a sentence, as in

$$
\alpha + \beta = \chi \eqno{(1)}
$$

Note that the equation is centered using a center tab stop. Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following the equation. Use (1), not Eq. (1) or equation (1), except at the beginning of a sentence: Equation (1) is . . .

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}
\begin{itemize}


\item The word data is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum ?0, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter o.
\item In American English, commas, semi-/colons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an inset, not an insert. The word alternatively is preferred to the word alternately (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word essentially to mean approximately or effectively.
\item In your paper title, if the words that uses can accurately replace the word using, capitalize the u; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones affect and effect, complement and compliment, discreet and discrete, principal and principle.
\item Do not confuse imply and infer.
\item The prefix non is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the et in the Latin abbreviation et al..
\item The abbreviation i.e. means that is, and the abbreviation e.g. means for example.

\end{itemize}


\section{USING THE TEMPLATE}

Use this sample document as your LaTeX source file to create your document. Save this file as {\bf root.tex}. You have to make sure to use the cls file that came with this distribution. If you use a different style file, you cannot expect to get required margins. Note also that when you are creating your out PDF file, the source file is only part of the equation. {\it Your \TeX\ $\rightarrow$ PDF filter determines the output file size. Even if you make all the specifications to output a letter file in the source - if you filter is set to produce A4, you will only get A4 output. }

It is impossible to account for all possible situation, one would encounter using \TeX. If you are using multiple \TeX\ files you must make sure that the ``MAIN`` source file is called root.tex - this is particularly important if your conference is using PaperPlaza's built in \TeX\ to PDF conversion tool.

\subsection{Headings, etc}

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads should be introduced. Styles named Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3, and Heading 4 are prescribed.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation Fig. 1, even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{An Example of a Table}
\label{table_example}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
\hline

\hline
Three & Four\\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}


   \begin{figure}[thpb]
      \centering
      \framebox{\parbox{3in}{We suggest that you use a text box to insert a graphic (which is ideally a 300 dpi TIFF or EPS file, with all fonts embedded) because, in an document, this method is somewhat more stable than directly inserting a picture.

      \caption{Inductance of oscillation winding on amorphous
       magnetic core versus DC bias magnetic field}
      \label{figurelabel}
   \end{figure}


Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity Magnetization, or Magnetization, M, not just M. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write Magnetization (A/m) or Magnetization {A[m(1)]}, not just A/m. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write Temperature (K), not Temperature/K.

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions.
